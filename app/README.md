# The APP

This is the actual dashboard and application part of the project and may or may not include the customer site.

> Note:- I've included all the functionalites of t3 Stack right which may not be useful in the project but I've just added them for now to get rid of the setup hassle and will remove the unused dependencies.

### What is the t3 Stack?

---

It's just a typescript NextJS app with Prisma, NextAuth, tRPC and tailwind already setup with best practices. Nothing complicated.

### What are we using?

---

Here's the list of the technologies we're using or at least currently setup in the project:

- NextJS (typescript)
- tRPC
- Tailwind (not sure if we'll use this)
- NextAuth (for Github Auth)
- Prisma (not sure if we'll use this)
- Mantine (very important and lifesaver)
- thirdweb (to connect with the smart contract and the blockachain)
